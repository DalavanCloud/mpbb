# MacPorts Buildbot Scripts

This folder contains a collection of scripts that will be run by the MacPorts
buildbot buildslaves for continuous integration and package precompilation.


## General structure

There is a driver script mpbb (Macports buildbot) would call the scripts for
the separated steps, using mpbb <step>. The single steps are provided by
separate scripts using the following scheme: mpbb-<step>. The steps that are
needed to be executed to build are the following ones:

    1. Update base without updating the portindex.

            mpbb selfupdate --prefix /opt/local

    2. Checkout ports tree and update the portindex.

            mpbb checkout \
                --prefix /opt/local \
                --workdir "$workdir" \
                --svn-url "$svnurl" \
                --svn-revision "$svnrev"

    3. Print to standard out a list of all subports for one port...

            mpbb list-subports --prefix /opt/local --port "$port"

       ...or for several.

            mpbb list-subports --prefix /opt/local "$port1" "$port2" ...

       for each port listed on stdout:

    4. install all dependencies of a given port

       mpbb install-dependencies --prefix /opt/local --port "$port"

    5. install a given port

       mpbb install-port --prefix /opt/local --port "$port"

    6. gather archives

       mpbb gather-archives --prefix /opt/local --port "$port" --workdir "$workdir" --archive-site "$archive_site" --staging-dir "$(pwd)/archive-staging"

    7. upload
       Must be implemented in the buildmaster

    8. deploy
       Must be implemented in the buildmaster

    9. cleanup

       mpbb cleanup --prefix /opt/local
       You will have to run this even if one of the previous steps failed.

## Step Implementation API

Step provider scripts are sourced and should provide a number of functions:

    - help: Should print a help message to stderr. Does not need to deal with
      ending the execution.
    - $command: Run the actual command.

Some shell variables are available for usage in your subcommand:

    - $command is the name of the subcommand
    - $option_archive_site is the URL to the packages archive that will be used
      to check for existing uploaded packages.
    - $option_staging_dir is the folder where archives that are distributable
      and should be upload must be put.
    - $option_port is the port that should be installed in the run of mpbb.
    - $option_prefix is the path to the MacPorts installation to use, as passed
      with --prefix.
    - $option_svn is the path to the svn binary to use.
    - $option_svn_revision is the revision number to checkout in the given
      Subversion repository.
    - $option_svn_url is a URL pointing to a Subversion repository that
      contains the dports and base subdirectories.
    - $option_workdir is a path to a directory that can be used to store
      temporary data. This data is retained between builds. You can, for
      example, store a Subversion checkout there.
